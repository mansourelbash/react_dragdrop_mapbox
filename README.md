# Mapbox with React, Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist, and ApexCharts Demo

This project is a full demo showcasing the integration of various technologies to create an interactive map application with customizable widgets featuring charts. The main technologies used include React, Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist for local data persistence, Mapbox for mapping functionalities, Tailwind CSS for styling, and ApexCharts for chart visualization.

## Features

- Interactive map powered by Mapbox, allowing users to navigate and interact with various locations.
- Customizable widgets featuring charts for data visualization.
- Drag-and-drop functionality for arranging and resizing widgets using React Grid Layout.
- Data persistence using Redux Persist to save user preferences and widget configurations locally.
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS for a visually appealing and mobile-friendly user interface.
- Skeleton loading effect for smooth user experience when adding new widgets.

## Getting Started

   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

1. Explore the map: Click on various locations on the map to view details about each location.
2. Add widgets: Click on any point on the map to add a widget displaying charts related to that location.
3. Customize widgets: Resize and rearrange widgets using drag-and-drop functionality provided by React Grid Layout.
4. Persist data: Any changes made to the widgets' configurations or added charts will be automatically saved locally using Redux Persist.
